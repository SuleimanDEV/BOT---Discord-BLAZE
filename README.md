# Funcionalidades

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!  

**Algumas funcionalidades pré-escritas abaixo:**

- Api DOUBLE ( BLAZE )
- Api CRASH ( BLAZE )
- Sistema de consultas:
- NOME, TELEFONE, CPF, CPF COMPLETA
- Consultas veiculos:
- CHASSI, PLACA
- Consultas gerais:
- BIN, CEP, COVID

**Lembrando que algumas consultas é necessário efetuar a troca de API para que funcione corretamente.**
